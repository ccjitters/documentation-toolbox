How to recover a Password through grub on systemd:

To recover your ROOT password on a systemd:

1) At startup, interrupt boot process by pressing and holding 'shift'.

2) In GRUB boot menu, press 'e' to enter edit mode. At the top of this screen it should read 'setparams'. If it does, move on to step 4. If not, restart and try again.

3) Use the keyboard arrow keys to navigate to a line that should follow this format:
	
	linux /boot/vmlinuz-[kernel version]-generic root=UUID=[letters and numbers]\[more letters and numbers] ro quiet splash vt.handoff=7

4) change 'ro splash vt.handoff=7' to 'rw init=/bin/bash' so that it now reads:

	linux /boot/vmlinuz-[kernel version]-generic root=UUID=[letters and numbers]\[more letters and numbers] rw init=/bin/bash

This will force your system to  bypass the splash 
5) press f10 to boot your system. It should show a bash terminal that ends in 'root@(none)'

6) type 'passwd' with no further arguments. This will prompt you to enter the new Root password, with a second comfirmation prompt. Enter this new password twice.

7) Reboot System.

8) There is no step 8. You did it. Good job.


//This is a general guideline for replacing the ROOT password, however by passing a username as an argument in step 6 you can change the password for individual user names as well, eg.:

	root@none: passwd user
