How to recover a Password through grub on system(SELinux):

Please note, if the entire system hard disk has been encrypted with LUKS, you would need to provide the LUKS password when prompted. Also, this procedure is applicable to systems running systemd which has been the default init system since Fedora 15, CentOS 7.14.04, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.0.

To recover your ROOT password on a systemd:

1) At startup, interrupt boot process by pressing and holding 'shift'.

2) In GRUB boot menu, press 'e' to enter edit mode. At the top of this screen it should read 'setparams'. If it does, move on to step 4. If not, restart and try again.

3) Use the keyboard arrow keys to navigate to the line that starts with 'linux16' and replace 'rhgb quiet' with 'rd.break enforcing=0'

Setting enforcing=0 will avoid performing a complete SELinux relabeling.

4) press ctrl+x to enter emergency mode

5) remount the hard drive with read/write access by typing 'mount -o remount,rw /sysroot' and hit enter

6) Type 'chroot /sysroot' and hit enter to access your system.

7) You can now change the root password by typing 'passwd'. Type the new password twice to confirm. If this was successful, you should get a message that says "all authenification tokens updated successfully"

8) Type 'exit' twice to reboot the system.

9) Login as root with your new password to restore the SELinux label to the /etc/shadow file with 'restorecon -v /etc/shadow'

10) Turn SELinux back to enforcing mode with 'setenforce 1'

11) There's no step 11. You did it. Yay!

//There are obviously more steps to resetting passwords with and SELinux system. This is by design. SELinux is a more secure system, often (almost always) used for production scientific or business systems. For non-SELinux systems, see:
